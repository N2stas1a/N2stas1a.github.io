## Key Components of the RHEL Family

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
This is the flagship commercial product, developed by Red Hat.  
It is tailored for enterprise use with paid subscriptions that provide professional support, security updates, and a defined lifecycle.

### Fedora
This is a community-driven, cutting-edge distribution that serves as a testing ground for new features and innovations that may eventually be incorporated into RHEL.

### CentOS
Originally a community-supported distribution built from the same open-source source code as RHEL, CentOS provided a free alternative with similar functionality.

### CentOS Stream
CentOS Stream is a continuously delivered distribution that serves as the **upstream development branch** for RHEL.  
It is a rolling-release version where development is happening live before it gets released to RHEL customers.

### Other Derivatives
Other projects, like **AlmaLinux** and **Rocky Linux**, have also emerged as community-driven clones of RHEL, aiming to provide a free, stable alternative with long-term support.

## The Shell Environment

The **shell** is the environment where the user interfaces with the operating system.  
**Bash** is the default command-line shell.  
**GNOME** is the standard graphical shell.

From a graphical shell, a terminal window running Bash can be started.

---

## Features of the Bash Shell

The Bash shell provides many features to make working with the shell easier, such as:
- Command line completion  
- Command history  
- Variables

## Using `--help`

Use the `--help` option - this is often the fastest way to get basic information about a command.  
Type this command and press **Enter** to see usage information.

---

## MAN Command

The **`man`** command in Linux is used to display the user manual of any command that can be run on the terminal.  
It provides a detailed view of the command and its options.

### Documentation Sections
Documentation in `man` is organized in different sections.  
For basic administration, the following sections matter most:

1. **Executable programs or shell commands**  
5. **File formats and conventions**  
8. **System administration commands**

All sections are described in `man man`.  
Use `man n intro` for an introduction to the topic of a specific section number.
